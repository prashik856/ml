## Applications of ML
AGI - Artificial General Intelligence. Human level intelligence. Till a far fetched dream.

## What is ML?
Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Example is to learn to play checkers with itself(about 10000 games).

If computer would have played less number of games, it would have performed worse.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Supervised Learning - Used most in real world applications. Most rapid advancements
- Unsupervised Learned 
- Recommender Systems
- Reinforcement Learning

## Practical advice for applying learning algorithms 
Make sure how to apply these algorithms
